      `I am self tutored developer with lots of curiosity about how the web works, even after graduating as a computer engineering student there are still a lot of knowledge about computer that i lack.`,
      `I took it upon myself to find out everything about application development process: How it work, what to learn, and how to implement and that is when i became friend with GOOGLE`,
      `I learnt HTML, CSS and Javascript, i learnt html easily, i struggle with css and then javascript open my eyes to logical reasoning and then i started feeling more like a programmer eventually it became the stepping stone for learning other languages fast and easy`,
      `Right now as a full-stack developer, I've been coding in React, React-Native, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind, PHP, Dart, Flutter etc to name a few, with lots of different development tools like VScode, github, gitlab, figma, cli, aws et.al`,
